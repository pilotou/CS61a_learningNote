### Q1: Taxicab Distance

An intersection in midtown Manhattan can be identified by an avenue and a street, which are both indexed by positive integers. The *Manhattan distance* or *taxicab distance* between two intersections is the number of blocks that must be traversed to reach one from the other, ignoring one-way street restrictions and construction. For example, [Times Square](https://goo.gl/maps/LeXMb2vHuAB2) is on 46th Street and 7th Avenue. [Ess-a-Bagel](https://goo.gl/maps/nM9ecFDD66D2) is on 51st Street and 3rd Avenue. The taxicab distance between them is 9 blocks (5 blocks from 46th to 51st street and 4 blocks from 7th avenue to 3rd avenue). Taxicabs cannot cut diagonally through buildings to reach their destination!

Implement `taxicab`, which computes the taxicab distance between two intersections using the following data abstraction. *Hint*: You don't need to know what a Cantor pairing function is; just use the abstraction.

```python
def intersection(st, ave):
    """Represent an intersection using the Cantor pairing function."""
    return (st+ave)*(st+ave+1)//2 + ave

def street(inter):
    return w(inter) - avenue(inter)

def avenue(inter):
    return inter - (w(inter) ** 2 + w(inter)) // 2

w = lambda z: int(((8*z+1)**0.5-1)/2)

def taxicab(a, b):
    """Return the taxicab distance between two intersections.

    >>> times_square = intersection(46, 7)
    >>> ess_a_bagel = intersection(51, 3)
    >>> taxicab(times_square, ess_a_bagel)
    9
    >>> taxicab(ess_a_bagel, times_square)
    9
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    return abs(street(a) - street(b)) + abs(avenue(a) - avenue(b))
```

```

```

### Q2: Squares only

Implement the function `squares`, which takes in a list of positive integers. It returns a list that contains the square roots of the elements of the original list that are perfect squares. Try using a list comprehension.

> You may find the `round` function useful.
>
> ```
> >>> round(10.5)
> 10
> >>> round(10.51)
> 11
> ```

```python
def squares(s):
    """Returns a new list containing square roots of the elements of the
    original list that are perfect squares.

>>> seq = [8, 49, 8, 9, 2, 1, 100, 102]
>>> squares(seq)
[7, 3, 1, 10]
>>> seq = [500, 30]
>>> squares(seq)
[]
"""
"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
	ans = []
    for i in s:
    	if i == 1:
    		ans.append(i)
    	for k in range(i):
    		if k*k == i:
    			ans.append(k)
    return ans
```

```
python3 ok -q squares
```

### Q3: G function

A mathematical function `G` on positive integers is defined by two cases:

```
G(n) = n,                                       if n <= 3
G(n) = G(n - 1) + 2 * G(n - 2) + 3 * G(n - 3),  if n > 3
```

Write a recursive function `g` that computes `G(n)`. Then, write an iterative function `g_iter` that also computes `G(n)`:

```python
def g(n):
    """Return the value of G(n), computed recursively.

>>> g(1)
1
>>> g(2)
2
>>> g(3)
3
>>> g(4)
10
>>> g(5)
22
>>> from construct_check import check
>>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'g', ['While', 'For'])
True
"""
"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
	if n <= 3:
    	return n
    else:
    	return g(n-1) + 2 * g(n-2) + 3 * g(n-3)
```

```python
def g_iter(n):
    """Return the value of G(n), computed iteratively.
>>> g_iter(1)
1
>>> g_iter(2)
2
>>> g_iter(3)
3
>>> g_iter(4)
10
>>> g_iter(5)
22
>>> from construct_check import check
>>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'g_iter', ['Recursion'])
True
"""
"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
	if n <= 3:
    	return n
    k = 4
    gn = 0
    g1 = 3
    g2 = 2
    g3 = 1
    while k <= n:
    	gn = g1 + 2*g2 + 3*g3
    	g3 = g2
    	g2 = g1
    	g1 = gn
    	k += 1
    return	gn
```

### Q4: Ping pong

The ping-pong sequence counts up starting from 1 and is always either counting up or counting down. At element `k`, the direction switches if `k` is a multiple of 7 or contains the digit 7. The first 30 elements of the ping-pong sequence are listed below, with direction swaps marked using brackets at the 7th, 14th, 17th, 21st, 27th, and 28th elements:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 [7] 6 5 4 3 2 1 [0] 1 2 [3] 2 1 0 [-1] 0 1 2 3 4 [5] [4] 5 6
```

Implement a function `pingpong` that returns the nth element of the ping-pong sequence. *Do not use any assignment statements; however, you may use def statements*.

> *Hint*: If you're stuck, try implementing `pingpong` first using assignment and a `while` statement. Any name that changes value will become an argument to a function in the recursive definition.

```python
def pingpong(n):
    """Return the nth element of the ping-pong sequence.
>>> pingpong(7)
7
>>> pingpong(8)
6
>>> pingpong(15)
1
>>> pingpong(21)
-1
>>> pingpong(22)
0
>>> pingpong(30)
6
>>> pingpong(68)
2
>>> pingpong(69)
1
>>> pingpong(70)
0
>>> pingpong(71)
1
>>> pingpong(72)
0
>>> pingpong(100)
2
>>> from construct_check import check
>>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'pingpong', ['Assign', 'AugAssign'])
True
"""
"*** YOUR CODE HERE(with assignment statement) ***"
	s = 0
    reverse = 1	
    for i in range(1, n+1):
    	
    	if reverse:
    		s += 1
    	else:
    		s -= 1
    	if i % 7 == 0 or has_seven(i):
    		reverse	= 1 - reverse	
    return	s
"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
	def fuc(count, value, step):
    	if count > n:
    		return value	
    	elif count % 7 == 0 or has_seven(count):
    		return fuc(count + 1, value	+ step, -step)
    	else:
    		return fuc(count + 1, value	+ step, step)  
    return fuc(1,0,1)
```

You may use the function `has_seven`, which returns True if a number `k` contains the digit 7 at least once.

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q pingpong
```

```
def has_seven(k):
    """Returns True if at least one of the digits of k is a 7, False otherwise.

    >>> has_seven(3)
    False
    >>> has_seven(7)
    True
    >>> has_seven(2734)
    True
    >>> has_seven(2634)
    False
    >>> has_seven(734)
    True
    >>> has_seven(7777)
    True
    """
    if k % 10 == 7:
        return True
    elif k < 10:
        return False
    else:
        return has_seven(k // 10)
```

### Q5: Count change

Once the machines take over, the denomination of every coin will be a power of two: 1-cent, 2-cent, 4-cent, 8-cent, 16-cent, etc. There will be no limit to how much a coin can be worth.

A set of coins makes change for `amount` if the sum of the values of the coins is `amount`. For example, the following sets make change for `7`:

- 7 1-cent coins
- 5 1-cent, 1 2-cent coins
- 3 1-cent, 2 2-cent coins
- 3 1-cent, 1 4-cent coins
- 1 1-cent, 3 2-cent coins
- 1 1-cent, 1 2-cent, 1 4-cent coins

Thus, there are 6 ways to make change for `7`. Write a function `count_change` that takes a positive integer `amount` and returns the number of ways to make change for `amount` using these coins of the future:

```python
def count_change(amount):
    """Return the number of ways to make change for amount.

>>> count_change(7)
6
>>> count_change(10)
14
>>> count_change(20)
60
>>> count_change(100)
9828
"""
"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***(method 1)"
	p = 1
	while p < amount:
    	p *= 2
        
	def count(amount, worth):
        if amount == 0:
            return 1
        elif amount < 0 or worth == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return count(amount - worth, worth) + count(amount, worth // 2)
  
	return count(amount, p // 2)

"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***(method 2)"
	def count_alt(amount, worth):
        if amount == 0:
            return 1
        elif amount < 0 or amount < worth:
            return 0
        else:
            return count_alt(amount - worth, worth) + count_alt(amount, worth * 2)

	return count_alt(amount, 1)
```

## Extra questions

> Extra questions are not worth extra credit and are entirely optional. They are designed to challenge you to think creatively!

### Q6: Anonymous factorial

The recursive factorial function can be written as a single expression by using a [conditional expression](http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions).

```
>>> fact = lambda n: 1 if n == 1 else mul(n, fact(sub(n, 1)))
>>> fact(5)
120
```

However, this implementation relies on the fact (no pun intended) that `fact` has a name, to which we refer in the body of `fact`. To write a recursive function, we have always given it a name using a `def` or assignment statement so that we can refer to the function within its own body. In this question, your job is to define fact recursively without giving it a name!

Write an expression that computes `n` factorial using only call expressions, conditional expressions, and lambda expressions (no assignment or def statements). *Note in particular that you are not allowed to use make_anonymous_factorial in your return expression.* The `sub` and `mul` functions from the `operator` module are the only built-in functions required to solve this problem:

```python
from operator import sub, mul

def make_anonymous_factorial():
    """Return the value of an expression that computes factorial.

    >>> make_anonymous_factorial()(5)
    120
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'make_anonymous_factorial', ['Assign', 'AugAssign', 'FunctionDef', 		'Recursion'])
    True
    """
    return 'YOUR_EXPRESSION_HERE'
```

```
python3 ok -q make_anonymous_factorial
