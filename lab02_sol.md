## Coding Practice

### Q3: Lambdas and Currying

We can transform multiple-argument functions into a chain of single-argument, higher order functions by taking advantage of lambda expressions. This is useful when dealing with functions that take only single-argument functions. We will see some examples of these later on.

Write a function `lambda_curry2` that will curry any two argument function using lambdas. See the doctest or refer to the [textbook](http://composingprograms.com/pages/16-higher-order-functions.html#currying) if you're not sure what this means.

```
def lambda_curry2(func):
    """
    Returns a Curried version of a two-argument function FUNC.
    >>> from operator import add
    >>> curried_add = lambda_curry2(add)
    >>> add_three = curried_add(3)
    >>> add_three(5)
    8
    """

## Environment Diagram Practice

### Q4: Lambda the Environment Diagram

Try drawing an environment diagram for the following code and predict what Python will output.

**You do not need to submit or unlock this question through Ok.** Instead, you can check your work with the [Online Python Tutor](http://tutor.cs61a.org/), but try drawing it yourself first!

```
>>> a = lambda x: x * 2 + 1
>>> def b(b, x):
...     return b(x + a(x))
>>> x = 3
>>> b(a, x)

______
```

### Q5: Make Adder

Draw the environment diagram for the following code:

```
n = 9
def make_adder(n):
    return lambda k: k + n
add_ten = make_adder(n+1)
result = add_ten(n)
```

There are 3 frames total (including the Global frame). In addition, consider the following questions:

1. In the Global frame, the name `add_ten` points to a function object. What is the intrinsic name of that function object, and what frame is its parent?
2. In frame `f2`, what name is the frame labeled with (`add_ten` or Î»)? Which frame is the parent of `f2`?
3. What value is the variable `result` bound to in the Global frame?

### Q6: Composite Identity Function

Write a function that takes in two single-argument functions, `f` and `g`, and returns another **function** that has a single parameter `x`. The returned function should return `True` if `f(g(x))` is equal to `g(f(x))`. You can assume the output of `g(x)` is a valid input for `f` and vice versa. You may use the `compose1` function defined below.

```
def compose1(f, g):
    """Return the composition function which given x, computes f(g(x)).

    >>> add_one = lambda x: x + 1        # adds one to x
    >>> square = lambda x: x**2
    >>> a1 = compose1(square, add_one)   # (x + 1)^2
    >>> a1(4)
    25
    >>> mul_three = lambda x: x * 3      # multiplies 3 to x
    >>> a2 = compose1(mul_three, a1)    # ((x + 1)^2) * 3
    >>> a2(4)
    75
    >>> a2(5)
    108
    """
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

def composite_identity(f, g):
    """
    Return a function with one parameter x that returns True if f(g(x)) is
    equal to g(f(x)). You can assume the result of g(x) is a valid input for f
    and vice versa.

    >>> add_one = lambda x: x + 1        # adds one to x
    >>> square = lambda x: x**2
    >>> b1 = composite_identity(square, add_one)
    >>> b1(0)                            # (0 + 1)^2 == 0^2 + 1
    True
    >>> b1(4)                            # (4 + 1)^2 != 4^2 + 1
    False
    """

    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

```

### Q7: Count van Count

Consider the following implementations of `count_factors` and `count_primes`:

```
def count_factors(n):
    """Return the number of positive factors that n has."""
    i, count = 1, 0
    while i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def count_primes(n):
    """Return the number of prime numbers up to and including n."""
    i, count = 1, 0
    while i <= n:
        if is_prime(i):
            count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def is_prime(n):
    return count_factors(n) == 2 # only factors are 1 and n
```

The implementations look quite similar! Generalize this logic by writing a function `count_cond`, which takes in a two-argument predicate function `condition(n, i)`. `count_cond` returns a one-argument function that counts all the numbers from 1 to `n` that satisfy `condition`.

```
def count_cond(condition):
    """Returns a function with one parameter N that counts all the numbers from
    1 to N that satisfy the two-argument predicate function CONDITION.

    >>> count_factors = count_cond(lambda n, i: n % i == 0)
    >>> count_factors(2)   # 1, 2
    2
    >>> count_factors(4)   # 1, 2, 4
    3
    >>> count_factors(12)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
    6

    >>> is_prime = lambda n, i: count_factors(i) == 2
    >>> count_primes = count_cond(is_prime)
    >>> count_primes(2)    # 2
    1
    >>> count_primes(3)    # 2, 3
    2
    >>> count_primes(4)    # 2, 3
    2
    >>> count_primes(5)    # 2, 3, 5
    3
    >>> count_primes(20)   # 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
    8
    """

```

### Q8: I Heard You Liked Functions...

Define a function `cycle` that takes in three functions `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, as arguments. `cycle` will return another function that should take in an integer argument `n` and return another function. That final function should take in an argument `x` and cycle through applying `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to `x`, depending on what `n` was. Here's what the final function should do to `x` for a few values of `n`:

- `n = 0`, return `x`
- `n = 1`, apply `f1` to `x`, or return `f1(x)`
- `n = 2`, apply `f1` to `x` and then `f2` to the result of that, or return `f2(f1(x))`
- `n = 3`, apply `f1` to `x`, `f2` to the result of applying `f1`, and then `f3` to the result of applying `f2`, or `f3(f2(f1(x)))`
- `n = 4`, start the cycle again applying `f1`, then `f2`, then `f3`, then `f1` again, or `f1(f3(f2(f1(x))))`
- And so forth.

*Hint*: most of the work goes inside the most nested function.

```
def cycle(f1, f2, f3):
    """Returns a function that is itself a higher-order function.

    >>> def add1(x):
    ...     return x + 1
    >>> def times2(x):
    ...     return x * 2
    >>> def add3(x):
    ...     return x + 3
    >>> my_cycle = cycle(add1, times2, add3)
    >>> identity = my_cycle(0)
    >>> identity(5)
    5
    >>> add_one_then_double = my_cycle(2)
    >>> add_one_then_double(1)
    4
    >>> do_all_functions = my_cycle(3)
    >>> do_all_functions(2)

    >>> do_more_than_a_cycle = my_cycle(4)
    >>> do_more_than_a_cycle(2)
    10
    >>> do_two_cycles = my_cycle(6)
    >>> do_two_cycles(1)
